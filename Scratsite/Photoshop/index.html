                    <nav>
                      <p>Scrat is a saber-toothed squirrel who loves acorns. He is commonly shown in scenes as a comic relief character, involving Manny, Sid and the rest, but never interacts with them, directly with a few exceptions. He appears in all four films, as well as his own short films, "Gone Nutty" and "No Time For Nuts" and has also made a cameo appearance in Sid's short, "Surviving Sid."<br>
                      <br>		
                      He usually has his own stories in the film, independent of the main plot, which are parallel with the journeys of the other main characters simply by chance, making the other characters meet him occasionally. Although not fully part of the gang, Scrat has proven major success around the world and has become a breakthrough character of the series</p>

                <h4>First apperance</h4>
                <nav>
                  <p>Scrat is shown in the first film, naively making his way through the ice age with his only possession: One single acorn. He tried to bury it into the snow, but with little success, as the snow itself was frozen solid. With enough force, he stomped down on it, causing the ice around it to crack. This began a chain reaction, which cracked more and more ice, until an entire glacier came crashing down, nearly smashing Scrat. However, Scrat escaped, only to be stepped on by masses of migrating animals. Eventually, Scrat would make his way to a tree and try to bury his acorn there, but inevitably would use it as a lightning rod by mistake. As time went on, Scrat unknowingly followed Manfred and the others up north, getting flung into the sky, and sliding through ice slides. Eventually His acorn is frozen and when he tries to thaw it, turns into a piece of popcorn. 2000 years later, At some point after the Ice Age films (as shown in the epilogue of the first movie), Scrat was frozen, while in pursuit of his acorn and thawed out 20,000 years later on a tropical island. However, he lost his nut, presumebly forever. Scrat took his anger out on a nearby palm tree and was hit on the head by a coconut, which more than compensates for 20,000 years and a lost acorn.

                  <br>
                  At some point after Scrat's travels up north, he stockpiled many acorns into a tree stump, but mistakenly stocked them too tight, which caused them to shoot out of the stump and into the sky, taking poor Scrat with them and eventually, one would jet back down to Earth with the impact of a guided missile, causing the land beneath to rupture. This began the continents to drift apart, leaving Scrat stranded on a single patch of land with nothing but an empty acorn shell.</p>

              <nav>
                <p>In the third film, Scrat encounters Scratte, a female saber-toothed squirrel, whom he competes with over his acorn, and is instantly smitten. However, after numerous conflicts, the two fall in love, only for Scrat to tire of her finicky nature and return to his old ways. After another battle between the two, Scrat is left the loser; he is stranded on the surface, while Scratte is left in the underground jungle of the dinosaurs... with Scrat's acorn. Scrat screams in frustration, having lost both his acorn and Scratte.</p>

              <h4>Scrat in real life?</h4>
              <nav>
                <p>Palaeozoologists working within the University of Science and Technology, Ottawa, were on an expedition in the Ottawan Mountain Range, and while engaged in a dig, came across what appeared to be the partially-preserved fossilized remains of a small mammalian creature, dated to be approximately 36 million years old. This corresponds with the current 31 million year estimate; the point at which, so-called “modern day” squirrels were thought to have diverged from a common ancestor and were later introduced into Western North America, most probably as a result of continental drift.<br>
                <br>
                Further laboratory analysis of the unidentified mammal’s jaw structure, revealed the presence of a primordial, saber-like tooth structure, while a computer-generated reconstruction of its backbone and tail revealed the animal to have possibly been a common ancestor of the common day squirrel. Phylogenetic analysis has reinforced this theory and lends tenuous, yet encouraging evidence to the fact that the creature “Scrat”, made famous by the popular Ice Age animated movies, may indeed have been a direct ancestor of the common Delmarva Fox Squirrel (Sciurus niger cinereus).</p>

              <h4>Short movies</h4>
              <nav>
                <p>Scrat was also the main character in two short films. In the first, entitled Gone Nutty, he loses his meticulously-organized collection of acorns in a catastrophic chain of events. By ramming his acorn into the hole in the exact middle of the collection, he shatters the pile and, incidentally, the continent and accidentally starts continental drift. In the second, No Time For Nuts, he finds a time machine left by an unfortunate time-traveler, and visits a number of historical events. He is eventually trapped in a future when acorn trees have gone extinct, but somehow manages to return to the series' time period. Scrat also had a cameo in the short film Surviving Sid that was significant to the plot.</p>
